    <h2>9th - 16th centuries: Muslim and Portuguese influence</h2>

    <p>
      Arab traders provided the first written accounts of The Gambia area in the
      ninth and tenth centuries. During the tenth century, Muslim merchants and
      scholars established communities in several West African commercial
      centres. Both groups established trans-Saharan trade routes. They carried
      out a large export trade of local people taken captive in raids and sold
      as slaves.[citation needed] Gold and ivory were also exported, and the
      trade routes were used to import manufactured goods to these areas.
